h2. Living Web / Living Science

The internet today is in motion. The web is composed of technologies and companies that represent competing regions of technological capital.

In some cases the compitition is motivated by financial interests, in others by better technologies. Your research should leverage these pools of technological capital. It needs to express the standards and capabilities of a modern web. We can give your research a new political and economic language.

Science is in motion. Ultimately, this is about joining the efforts of scientific research with the collaborative tools and technologies of the web.
