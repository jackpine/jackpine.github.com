h1. Funding science, etc.

I'm trying to understand the funding structure of science better.

I'm sure funding drives a lot of what scientists do day-to-day.

How do you get funding the first time?

How do you use that funding in such a way as to promote getting repeated
funding?

Is your audience _strictly_ the folks that gave you funding?  Put
another way, how much is it acceptable to build an audience outside of
those that gave you funding.

This is particularly applicable to self-publishing on the web, outside
of any existing journal. You could target anyone in the greater
public.

However, presumably your grant has specific goals in it, and it might
not be in line with your bottom line to spend time/money on making your
research easier for the general public to consume

I imagine that funding is one really big source of anxiety and effort
for folks trying to do science.

How do you optimize your spending to meet those that gave you funding,
reach those that might give you funding in the future, while all the
while trying to reach the general public.

I'm so interested in this because any force that has the power to
sustain your endeavors (read: you can't function without some level of
funding), is going to exhert pressure on your working relationships.
Sometimes that pressure isn't addressed directly or expediently. If you
are paying an analyst or a programmer to help you with some grant funded
project, their efforts will undoubtedly be less directed then yours.
It's your project after all.

That's why, when collaborating with scientists, it is essential to have
some level of understanding of where and why the money that ultimately
funds the project is coming from.

There are primarily two types of funding in the non-profit and academic
world: one time grant funding, and structural repeating income.
